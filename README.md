Hi Stefan,

i am not quite sure if i understood the requirements for the second part of task correctly this time.

I have destroyed the previous cdn distribution and created a new one using terraform with additional cache behavior (path patterns) for both /images and /asstes as you can see on the picture above. 

I have also updated te repository with a new example.tf file.

If it is still not the solution you wanted me to achieve please provide with some more details on that. I would be grateful.
